Building
--------

There are still many asserts in the engine. Most of them are irrelevant and should be removed, but while it's not done, the asserts will effectively kill the engine when triggered in the Debug build. Use Release or RelWithDebInfo build if you intend to play (automatically set as RelWithDebInfo in the build scripts).

### Linux

#### Setting up the repository

Type this in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Heic0/SeriousSamClassic.git SeriousSamClassic
```

#### Copy official game data (optional)

If you have access to a copy of the game (either by CD or through Steam),
you can copy the *.gro files from the game directory to the repository.
(SeriousSamClassic/SamTFE is the directory of the game Serious Sam Classic The First Encounter, SeriousSamClassic/SamTSE is the directory of the game Serious Sam Classic The Second Encounter)

#### Building (only for SS:TFE)

Type this in your terminal:

```
cd SeriousSamClassic/SamTFE/Sources
./build-linux64.sh -DTFE=TRUE	# use build-linux32.sh for 32-bits
```

#### Building (only for SS:TSE)

Type this in your terminal:

```
cd SeriousSamClassic/SamTSE/Sources
./build-linux64.sh        	# use build-linux32.sh for 32-bits
```

### FreeBSD

#### Setting up the repository

Type this in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Heic0/SeriousSamClassic.git SeriousSamClassic
```

#### Copy official game data (optional)

If you have access to a copy of the game (either by CD or through Steam),
you can copy the *.gro files from the game directory to the repository.
(SeriousSamClassic/SamTFE is the directory of the game Serious Sam Classic The First Encounter, SeriousSamClassic/SamTSE is the directory of the game Serious Sam Classic The Second Encounter)

#### Building (only for SS:TFE)

Type this in your terminal:

```
cd SeriousSamClassic/SamTFE/Sources
cp -vfr Entities/PlayerWeapons_old.es Entities/PlayerWeapons.es
mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DTFE=TRUE ..
make -j4
cp -v SeriousSam DedicatedServer MakeFONT ecc ../../Bin
cp -v Debug/*.so ../../Bin
```

#### Building (only for SS:TSE)

Type this in your terminal:

```
cd SeriousSamClassic/SamTSE/Sources
cp -vfr EntitiesMP/PlayerWeapons_old.es EntitiesMP/PlayerWeapons.es
mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
make -j4
cp -v SeriousSam DedicatedServer MakeFONT ecc ../../Bin
cp -v Debug/*.so ../../Bin
```

Note that the CD version of SS:TSE used MP3 for music. You will need to build / get `libamp11lib.so` and copy it inside `Bin` with the other libs to have music. Steam version uses ogg and doesn't need this library.
